\textbf{
Decide whether you think the following statement is true or false. If it is true, give a short explanation. If it is false, give a counterexample.

\emph{Let G be an arbitrary flow network, with a source s, a sink t, and a positive integer capacity $c_e$ on every edge e. If f is a maximum s-t flow in G, then f saturates every edge out of s with flow(i.e. for all edges e out of s, we have $f(e)=c_e$).}

It is false. Consider the example in Pic~\ref{pic_4}.

We can see that $e(s,v_4)$ is not equal to its capacity.
