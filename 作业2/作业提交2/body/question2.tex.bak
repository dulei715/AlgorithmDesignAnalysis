Suppose we have $n$ distinct number $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$. 
%In order to simplify our process of prove, we can further suppose that $n=2^k-1$, where $k\in N^{+}$.
%We note $b_1,b_2,...,b_n$ as the heap array order of $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$. According to the process of HEAPSORT, each step of swap the first element and the last element and heapfiying is at
