\textbf{
Suppose now that you're given $n\times n$ grid graph $G$.(An $n\times n$ grid graph is just the adjacency graph of an $n\times n$ chessboard. To be completely precise, it is a graph whose node set is the set of all ordered pairs of natural numbers $(i,j)$, where $1\leq i \leq n$ and $1\leq j \leq n$; the nodes $(i,j)$ and $(k,l)$ are joined by an edge if and only if $|i-k|+|j-l|=1$.)
}

\textbf{
We use some of the terminology of the previous question. Again, each node $v$ is labeled by a real number $x_v$; you may assume that all these labels are distinct. Show how to find a local minimum of $G$ using only $O(n)$ probes to the nodes of $G$.(Note that $G$ has $n^2$ nodes.)

We first give a example. Consider the grid graph show in figure~\ref{question_4_example}.

We can use divide-and-conquer to handle this problem. Intuitively, we can find the minimum element $tmin$ in the middle column and test whether both the left and right element are greater than $tmin$. If so, we can return $tmin$ directly, else we choose the one that less than $tmin$ and then recursive choose the minimum element.

Considering that we should declare the specific area, we can add a board to the grid graph $G$, and keep the elements on board are always greater than the current element. We show the steps as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item First, we add a boarder to $G$ as is showed in figure~\ref{question_4_example_2}. And fill the border with the value greater than all value in $G$.
  \item a
  \item a
