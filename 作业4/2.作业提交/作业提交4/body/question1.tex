\textbf{
Show how to sort $n$ integers in the range $0$ to $n^6-1$ in $O(n)$ time.
}

\hspace*{\fill} \\
We can use radix sorting to handle this problem. The steps are showed as follow:
\begin{itemize}
  \item We transform each of the $n$ integer in to $n$ radix number.
  \item We sorted the $n$ integer from the lowest digit to the highest digit by counting sort.
\end{itemize}

After these two steps, we can get the ordered result. We show the algorithm in Alg~\ref{quest1}.
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{n-radix sort}
\label{quest1}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE $n$ integer $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$
\STATE Transform $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ into $n$-radix numbers
\FOR{$i=1;i<=6;++i$}
    \STATE{Sort $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ by $i$-$th$ least digit using counting sort}
\ENDFOR
\STATE Return sorted result
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

We can find that, the time of each counting sort is $O(n)$, and the total time cost is $O(n)$.
