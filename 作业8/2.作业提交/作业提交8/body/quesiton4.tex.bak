3.Let $G=(V,E) be a directed graph, with source $s\in V$, sink $t\in V$, and nonegative edge capacities $\{c_e\}$. Give a polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether $G$ has
a unique minimum $s-t$ cut(i.e., an $s-t$ of capacity strictly less than that of all other $s-t$ cuts).

\emph{Let $G$ be an arbitrary flow network, with a source $s$, a sink $t$, and a positive integer capacity $c_e$ on every edge $e$; and let (A,B) be a minimum $s-t$ cut with respect to these capacitys\{$c_e:e\in E$\}. Now suppose we add 1 to every capacity; then (A,B) is still a minimum $s-t$ cut with respect to these new capacities \{$1+c_e:e\in E$\}.}
