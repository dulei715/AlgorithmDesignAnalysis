3.Let $G=(V,E)$ be a directed graph, with source $s\in V$, sink $t\in V$, and nonnegative edge capacities $\{c_e\}$. Give a polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether $G$ has a unique minimum $s-t$ cut(i.e., an $s-t$ of capacity strictly less than that of all other $s-t$ cuts).
}

We can first invoke ``Scaling-Max-Flow" to get the maximum flow, which is also the minimum cut. 
Then we choose a minimum cut $A_1(s,t)$. 
For each edge $e\in A_1(s,t)$, we add the capacity by 1 and re-compute the minimum. 
If for each edge's increasing 1 of its capacity, the value of minimum cut increases, 
then the original graph has a unique minimum $s-t$ cut, else it has none.
