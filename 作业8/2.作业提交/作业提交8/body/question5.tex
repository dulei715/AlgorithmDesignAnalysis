\textbf{
5.Let $G=(V,E)$ be a directed graph, and suppose that for each node $v$, the number of edges into $v$ is equal to the number of edges out of $v$. That is for all $v$,
$$|\{(u,v):(u,v)\in E\}|=|\{(v,w):(v,w)\in E\}|$$
}

\textbf{
Let $x,y$ be two nodes of $G$, and suppose that there exist $k$ mutually edge-disjoint paths from $y$ to $x$? Give a proof or a counterexample with explanation.
