\textbf{
Suppose it's nearing the end of the semester and you're taking \emph{n} courses, each with a final project that still has to be done. Each project will be graded on the following scale: It will be assigned an integer number on a scale of 1 to $g>1$, higher numbers being better grades. Your goal, of course, is to maximize your average grade on the \emph{n} projects.
}

\textbf{
You have a total of $H>n$ hours in which to work on the $n$ projects cumulatively, and you want to decide how to divide up this time. For simplicity, assume $H$ is a positive integer, and you'll spend an integer number of hours on each project. To figure out how best divide up your time, you've come up with a set of functions $f_i: i=1,2,...,n$(rough estimates, of course) for each of your $n$ courses; if you spend $h\leq H$ hours on the project for course $i$, you'll get a grade of $f_i(h)$.(You may assume that the functions $f_i$ are \emph{$f_i$} are \emph{nondecreasing} if $h<h'$, then $f_i(h)\leq f_i(h')$.)
}

\textbf{
So the problem is: Given these functions{$f_i$}, decide how many hours to spend on each project(in integer values only) so that your average grade, as computed according to the $f_i$, is as large as possible. In order to be efficient, the running time of your algorithm should be polynomial in $n,g$, and $H$; none of these quantities should appear as an exponent in your running time.

We can easy to get the following equation:
