\textbf{
Let us say that a graph $G=(V,E)$ is \emph{near-tree} if it is connected and has at most $n+8$ edges, where $n=|V|$. Give an algorithm with running time $O(n)$ that takes a near-tree $G$ with costs on its edges, and returns minimum spanning tree of $G$. You may assume that all the edge costs are distinct.
