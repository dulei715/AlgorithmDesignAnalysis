\textbf{
Consider the Minimum Spanning Tree Problem on an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, with a cost $c_e\leq 0$ on each edge, where the costs may not all be different. If the costs are not all distinct, there can in general be many distinct minimum-costs solutions. Suppose we are given a spanning tree $T\subseteq E$ with the guarantee that for every $e\in T$, $e$ belongs to \emph{some} minimum-cost spanning tree in $G$. Can we conclude that $T$ itself must be a minimum-cost spanning tree in $G$? Give a proof or a counterexample with explanation.

\hspace*{\fill} \\
$T$ itself is a minimum-cost spanning tree in $G$.

\noindent
$T$ may not be a minimum-cost spanning tree in $G$.

Let us consider the following instance shown in Fig~\ref{fig_5_1}.

Two of its minimum spanning trees are shown in Fig~\ref{fig_5_2}.

Then we illustrate an example shown in Fig~\ref{fig_5_3}. It is not a minimum-costs spanning tree.
